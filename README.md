# starcontroller

starcontroller was created to be a fullscreen touchscreen app run on a raspberry pi. It was created to be a puzzle at a kids birthday party. The kids had to find usb keys hidden under 2 trees. When the system detected those keys inserted they lit up an image. When both keys were inserted they got a simple cipher they could use for decoding an encoded message.

Hopefully someone else will find this useful.

It uses gjs and is a fullscreen gnome application using webkit and gtk/webkit communication.
